The Timeline Ontology
=====================

About
-----

The [Timeline Ontology](http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/timeline.owl#) is centered around the notion of timeline, seen here as a way to identify a temporal backbone. A timeline may support a signal, a video, a score, a work, etc.

The [old project repository location at SourceForge](http://motools.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/motools/time/) is now deprecated. All new developments will be pushed to this repository location here at GitHub.
